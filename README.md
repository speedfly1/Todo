# Todo App with Angular and Node.js

This is a simple Todo application built using **Angular** for the front-end and **Node.js** (with Express) for the back-end. The app uses **MongoDB** as the database to store the todos.

### Architecture Explanation

The Todo application follows a **client-server architecture** with a **three-tier architecture** design, comprising:

- **Frontend (Client-side)**: Built with **Angular 16** to provide a rich, interactive user interface.
- **Backend (Server-side)**: Built with **Node.js** and **Express** to serve APIs that interact with the database.
- **Database**: **MongoDB**, a NoSQL database, is used to store and manage todo data.
- **Lock machinsm**: I lock editing todo by cache it with todo id, this way when other user want to edit the todo he can't get the data - i also added ttl in case if something went wrong and the session ended unexpectedly
- **Live Update**: My architecture use node js event emitter with sse on the angular size, when you have any edit\add\delete the server raise event and the client consume it, sadly due the time i had this code does not work but it does exists for review.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 22 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud instance)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (If you don't have it, install via `npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Setup Node.js Server

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the server code):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/speedfly1/Todo
    cd Todo
    ```

2. **Install dependencies** for the Node.js backend:
    ```bash
    cd ServerSide
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up MongoDB**:
    - If you're using **local MongoDB**, make sure your MongoDB service is running on the default port (`localhost:27017`).
    - If you're using **MongoDB Atlas**, you will need to create a cluster and get the connection URI. Update the connection URI in the `server/config.js` file.

4. **MongoDB Configuration**:
    - Open `ServerSide/config.js` and update the MongoDB URI if necessary.
    - The server is set up to connect to a MongoDB database called `HomeAssignment`.

5. **Start the server**:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

    This will start the Node.js server on `http://localhost:3000`. The server exposes the following routes:

    - `GET /todos`: Fetch all todos
    - `GET /todo/:id`: Fetch todo by id
    - `POST /todo`: Create a new todo
    - `PUT /todos/:id`: Update an existing todo
    - `PATCH /todos/:id`: Update todo status
    - `DELETE /todos/:id`: Delete a todo

### Setup Angular Client

1. **Navigate to the Angular client folder**:
    ```bash
    cd ClientSide\TodoApp
    ```

2. **Install dependencies** for the Angular application:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Update the API URL** in the Angular service:
    - Open `src/app//service/todo.service.ts` and update the API base URL to match your Node.js server. For example:
        ```typescript
        private apiUrl = 'http://localhost:3000/todos';
        ```

4. **Run the Angular development server**:
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```

    This will start the Angular client on `http://localhost:4200`. The app will now communicate with the Node.js backend to create, read, update, and delete todos.

### MongoDB Setup

In your **MongoDB database**, you should have a collection named `TODO`. You don't need to manually create this collection as the app will automatically create it when a document is added for the first time.

Each **todo document** will have the following structure:

#### **Todo Schema:**

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,       // Automatically generated by MongoDB
  name: String,       // Title of the todo
  description: String, // Optional description of the todo
  Status: enum,  // Boolean indicating if the todo is completed or not
}
